  Wyatt Solutions is a boutique team specializing in technical writing for SaaS companies. We understand the critical role clear, reliable documentation plays—for your team, your company, and your customers. Our mission is to take the headache out of writing, so you can focus on building your product, not explaining it.
</p>
<p>
  We leverage professional tools like <strong>code2doc</strong> and analytics to create and update documentation directly from your codebase. This approach means fewer mistakes, faster turnarounds, and docs that actually stay up to date as your software evolves. Every document is handcrafted by expert writers who work closely with you to ensure content aligns with your product and brand.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>API Docs</strong> — Easy-to-follow guides that help developers get up and running quickly with your APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>User Manuals &amp; Guides</strong> — Clear instructions that help users get the most out of your product, informed by real user pain points.</li>
  <li><strong>Help Center Articles &amp; FAQs</strong> — Resources that reduce support tickets and keep customers happy.</li>
  <li><strong>Release Notes</strong> — Concise updates that let users know what’s new or changed.</li>
  <li><strong>Onboarding Guides</strong> — Step-by-step walkthroughs to get new users started without frustration.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal Docs</strong> — SOPs and runbooks that keep your team aligned and efficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance Docs</strong> — Documentation to help you meet audits and regulatory requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Training Materials</strong> — Tutorials and courses to get your team or customers up to speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We’re not a giant agency—we’re a boutique shop that cares about the details and works closely with your team. Our use of code2doc tools lets us automate the tedious parts, so we can focus on making your documentation clear, helpful, and tailored to your audience. We understand the fast pace of SaaS—frequent updates, lots of moving parts—and we know how to keep your documentation in sync.
