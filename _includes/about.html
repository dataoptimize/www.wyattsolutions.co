        <p>Wyatt Solutions, is a botique, focused team that specializes in technical writing for SaaS companies. We know how important clear, reliable documentation is—for your team, company and customers. Our goal is to take the headache out of writing so you can spend more time building your product and less time explaining it.

We use professional tools like code2doc and analytics to help us create and update docs straight from your codebase. This means fewer mistakes, faster turnarounds, and documentation that actually stays up to date as your software evolves. All of our documentation is handcrafted by writers with expertise in your product and work with you to align the content to your brand.

What We Write Most Often
API Docs — Easy-to-follow guides that help developers get up and running quickly with your APIs.

User Manuals & Guides — Simple instructions that help your users get the most out of your product based on data about user painpoints.

Help Center Articles & FAQs — Resources that reduce support tickets and keep your customers happy.

Release Notes — Clear updates that let your users know what’s new or changed.

Onboarding Guides — Step-by-step walkthroughs to get new users started without frustration.

Internal Docs — SOPs and runbooks that keep your team aligned and efficient.

Compliance Docs — Documentation to help you meet audits and regulatory requirements.

Training Materials — Tutorials and courses to get your team or customers up to speed.

Why Work With Us?
We’re not a giant agency. We’re a boutique all-in-one shop that cares about getting the details right and working closely with your team. Using code2doc tools means we can automate the boring parts and focus on making your documentation clear and helpful for the intended audience. Plus, we get the fast pace of SaaS — frequent updates, lots of moving parts — and we know how to keep your documentation in sync.
